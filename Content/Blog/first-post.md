## Cognitive Biases and Their Impact on UX/UI Design Part 01

### Introduction
This article delves into some key cognitive biases and explores how they can be mitigated to improve the user experience, it
is inspired by Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman and his book Thinking, Fast and Slow. 
Our brains are wired with cognitive biases—thinking errors and mental shortcuts that influence our decisions and perceptions. These biases can affect every aspect of human experience, including how users interact with digital products. 
For designers, understanding these biases is essential to creating interfaces that are yes intuitive but also capable of minimizing user frustration. By grasping how biases shape behavior, designers can build products that users not only enjoy but also trust.

#### As you read through, think about your own experiences with websites or apps. Have you ever abandoned a task because of poor design? How do you think biases may have played a role in your decision?

### Cognitive Dissonance in User Interaction
When we are unable to achieve something, we often convince ourselves it wasn't worthwhile anyway, for example, if you didn't get a job, rather than admitting someone else was more qualified, you might tell yourself you didn't want the job anyway. Most of the time, cognitive dissonance occurs when users encounter conflicting information or more often experiences that challenge their beliefs. In UX/UI design, this can happen when a product fails to meet users' expectations. Imagine you visit a website that seems professional and trustworthy, but when it comes time to make a purchase, you encounter a confusing or poorly designed checkout process. This inconsistency can cause users to question their initial trust in the site, potentially leading them to abandon the transaction altogether.

**Design Strategy:** To mitigate cognitive dissonance, designers should aim for consistency across both design and functionality. Clear, well-structured user journeys help ensure that the user experience aligns with user expectations. Regular usability testing can highlight inconsistencies before they lead to user frustration.

### The Spotlight Effect in User Perception
The spotlight effect is the phenomenon where people tend to believe others are observing them more than they actually are. For example, you are late at a dinner event and feel like everyone is judging you, or you spill sauce on your shirt and think everyone at the party notices.
Users often feel that their actions on a website are more noticeable than they are. This spotlight effect can cause anxiety, especially in social media or e-commerce contexts where users may worry about making mistakes or being judged.

**Design Strategy:** To ease this anxiety, designers should focus on creating interfaces that are forgiving and reassuring. For example, providing subtle, positive feedback when forms are completed correctly can build user confidence. Non-intrusive error messages and the promotion of privacy and security features can further reduce user stress, encouraging smoother interactions.

#### Next time you design a form or checkout flow, think about how you can reduce user anxiety. Can you add features that reassure users their actions are correct or private?

### The Anchoring Effect in Decision-Making
Fo example, you need to sell your pc, you will start with a high price so the final negotiated price will seems reasonable by comparison. Anchoring occurs when users rely heavily on the first piece of information they see. This can be used positively in UX/UI design, such as using a well-placed call to action or again, setting initial pricing expectations.

**Design Strategy:** Use anchors to guide users towards desired actions. Highlight the most important features or benefits of the product early in the user journey. For example, showcasing a popular pricing plan as a default option can steer users towards that option. Additionally, using anchors like "Most Popular" labels can help guide users’ choices.

### The Halo Effect and First Impressions
When one positive aspect like physical appearance, charisma, causes people to judge other unrelated qualities like, intelligence, kindness, more favorably. And, first impressions are crucial also in design. If users have a positive initial experience, they are more likely to overlook minor issues later. Conversely, a poor first impression overshadow the entire user experience.

**Design Strategy:** Invest in high-quality, visually appealing design elements, especially on landing pages and onboarding screens. Ensure that the first interaction a user has with your product is smooth and engaging.

### Gambler’s Fallacy and User Behavior
The gambler’s fallacy can lead users to make irrational decisions based on perceived patterns. After three heads in a row, many expect tails next, though each flip is independent. This fallacy, the belief in a balancing force, affects decisions in gambling, judging, and more. In design, this might manifest in users expecting certain outcomes after repeated actions, such as frequent clicks on a non-responsive button.

**Design Strategy:** Ensure that user interactions lead to predictable and consistent outcomes. Avoid elements that could mislead users into thinking a different result is due after repeated attempts. Clearly communicate the functionality and expected outcomes of interactive elements. If a button or link won’t produce an immediate result maybe becouse it is a working progress, provide feedback so users don’t feel annoyed by your product.

#### will you take these cognitive biases into account in the future?
